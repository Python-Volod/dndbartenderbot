### D&D Bartender Discord bot

This is bot I made for my players and somehow decided it can be useful to someone else. 

------------

This bot can
- Throw dice (d4 d6 d8 d10 d20 d100)
- Convert value of D&D coins
- Give information about Spells (Player Handbook and Xanathar's guide to everything), 
Weapons, Monsters (Monster Manual and Volo's Guide to Monsters)

There's no token in the code. Original bot available by " D&D Bartender#5137 "
Code published only because of my love of Open Source and a wish to participicate with something useful. Python is not my main language (I'm more C++ masochist). If you  want to improve it please feel free to commit (just don't do it in master branch).
I didn't tested responses for all items, so if you will find there is something wrong please create issue.
